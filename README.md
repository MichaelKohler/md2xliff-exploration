test-md2xliff
==

I'm trying to figure out if we really can use md2xliff for activate.mozilla.community. We've had several problems in the past and I'm trying to do a real use-case in this repository. I will write all commands I'm running and every step I take in this README and will commit after every step to be able to show results.

Initial commit
---

I've set up two scripts to do md -> xliff (extract) and xliff -> md (reconstruct). I've additionally created a ```test.md``` file which holds the first iteration of our content.
